# Modul 1 : Coding Standards

### Reflection 1
After learning more about **coding standards** in previous classes,
I tried to implement them in this project. For example,
I always name my variables and my functions as clear
as possible to make my codes more readable and easier to
maintain. Nevertheless, after reviewing codes I wrote once more,
I found that I haven't applied enough secure coding concepts to
protect the program from unwanted occurrence. I only validate input data
to prevent runtime errors in the program. I think it is not
secure enough since various attacks could still threaten
this program. Those mistakes can be improved by applying more
specific input data validation so that such things like hazardous characters,
and attempts of injection attack won't harm the program.
